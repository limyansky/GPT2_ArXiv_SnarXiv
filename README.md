# A GPT2-Powered Generator of Fake Scientific Papers

This project fine-tunes [GPT2](huggingface.co/gpt2) to generate realistic-sounding titles to scientific papers.

It was inspired by David Simmons-Duffin's [arXiv vs. snarXiv](https://snarxiv.org/vs-arxiv/), which uses context-free grammars for much the same task.

While originally intended as a fun game, recent cases of [lawyers citing fake court cases from ChatGPT](https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-courts-e15023d7e6fdf4f099aa122437dbb59b) have cast this project in a new light. I'm not a lawyer, but I am a scientist, and I hope this project helps others understand just how closely you need to keep an eye on LLM's when using them in your everyday work.
